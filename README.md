# 11/8 - During lab we finished setting up our docker-compose and followed the write up in order to get test cases working. Last week we created the sql data bases and updated our InitData folder. We plan on getting more functionality in the website using HTML and JS and creating the pages for our website.

# 11/15 - Over the course of the week, we implemented most of the partials and pages we will need for the project. We also added tests-cases for the get method for all pages as well as routes. In the coming week we plan to implement routes for all the post methods as well as tests and dynamic element creation.
